# Monotowns
[Graphical vector maps](http://tejp.github.io/monotowns) that I made for a friend's master thesis.

This project includes some random tools which parse the data from different textfiles into one array. The array is used to point out towns on a map with the javascript library [kartograph.js](https://github.com/kartograph/kartograph.js). To find the location I used the [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) library. The maps were created with the python library [kartograph.py](https://github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py).

You can find the awesome kartograph framework on [http://kartograph.org/](http://kartograph.org/).

<sup><sup>I also made a couple of maps using the Google maps API.</sup></sup>
